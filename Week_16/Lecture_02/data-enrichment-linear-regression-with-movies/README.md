## Activity: Create a Linear Regression Model with Statsmodels for Revenue

- Today we will be working with JUST the data data from the TMDB API for years 2000-2021. 
    - We will prepare the data for modeling
        - Some feature engineering
        - Our usual Preprocessing
        - New steps for statsmodels!
    - We will fit a statsmodels linear regression.
    - We Will inspect the model summary.
    - We will create the visualizations to check assumptions about the residuals.



- Next class we will continue this activity.
    - We will better check all 4 assumptions.
    - We will discuss tactics for dealing with violations of the assumptions. 
    - We will use our coefficients to make stakeholder recommendations.
    
### Concepts Demonstrated
- Using `glob` for loading in all final files. 
- Statsmodels OLS
- QQ-Plot
- Residual Plot
