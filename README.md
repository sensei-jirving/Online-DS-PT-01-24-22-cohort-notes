## Tips and Tricks

### Pandas `pd.read_excel` error.

- If you get an error message that mentions openpyxl when you attempt to to run `pd.read_excel`:
	- Add this line of code at the very beginning of your notebook (before import pandas) and restart your kernel. 
	- Menu Bar > `Runtime` > `Restart Runtime`
```python
!pip install openpyxl==3.0.0
```
